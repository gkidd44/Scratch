    <h3>History of the name Garrett:</h3>

    <p>Garrett is a surname and given name of Germanic and of Old French origins. It is one of the many baptismal surnames to have been derived from the popular given names of Gerardus, Gerard and Gerald in 12th-century England. Both of these names were taken to 
        Britain by the conquering Normans and are the Old French versions of ancient Germanic personal names. The name Gerard (or Germanic: Gerhard) is composed of the Germanic elements gēr or gār (meaning 'spear') and hard ('brave', 'hard' or 'strong'), while 
        Gerald is composed of again gēr or gār ('spear') and wald ('to rule'). Although Garrett remains predominantly only a last name in the UK and Ireland, elsewhere in the English-speaking world it is also a common first name (e.g. in the United States).</p>

    <p>Garrett is a boy's name of both German and Irish origin. It came about from two first names, Gerard and Gerald, which were created during the Dark Ages. Those were economic hard times, so to foster a sense of well-being, names that seemed powerful were 
        popular. Garrett is an Irish version of Gerard, which has the components gari, meaning "spear" and “hard,” implying bravery. Parents of future sports stars apparently liked the name a lot: Garrett Richards plays for the Los Angeles Angels, and Garrett 
        Hartley most recently played for the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>

    <p>"Garrett" with two R's and two T's is the only proper way to spell the name. All other forms are improper.</p>
